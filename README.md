# Pymaceuticals

This is a project to run data analysis and generate statistics on drug regimens to decrease tumor volume. We'll be using data provided from a recent animal study consisting of 249 mice to generate the statistics. In particular we are looking at the Capomoulin drug and comparing it with the other drug regimens observed in the study.
Through the different statistics run, plot generated, and trends observed, there are two drug regimens that are effective in reducing the tumor volume. These two drug regimens are Capomoulin and Ramicane. 
I've also added some other observations in my report pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb.
Please refer to this file for further observations/statistics.
